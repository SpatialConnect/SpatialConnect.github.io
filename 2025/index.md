## Workshop Overview

SpatialConnect 2025 is dedicated to exploring cutting-edge research and applications in **Spatial Intelligence** aimed at shaping **Smart and Connected Communities (S&CC)**. The workshop focuses on use-inspired, community-engaged research that addresses real-world challenges identified facing local communities through collaboration with local governments, industry, and other key stakeholders. The goal is to advance computational geospatial science to deliver actionable solutions that strengthen public services and infrastructure. We invite submissions that showcase how research problems are identified through direct stakeholder engagement or data-driven analysis of specific regions. Successful papers will demonstrate how computational tools have been applied to improve decision-making, operational efficiency, or resource allocation. Contributions may include insights gained from fieldwork, coordination with public agencies, or partnerships with local institutions.

## Workshop Format

**Half-day afternoon mini-conference featuring:**

- **Keynote Talk**: One Invited Distinguished Speaker
- **Technical Sessions**: Peer-reviewed Paper Presentations  
- **Awards**: Best Paper Award and Best Paper Award Runner-Up

## Call for Papers

The workshop seeks high-quality short (4 pages) papers that have not been published in other academic outlets and are not concurrently under peer review. Once accepted, at least one author is required to register for the workshop and the ACM SIGSPATIAL conference, as well as attend the workshop to present the accepted work which will then appear in the ACM Digital Library. As SpatialConnect papers appear in the ACM SIGSPATIAL proceedings we follow the same submission process.

## Paper Format

Accepted SpatialConnect’25 papers will appear in the ACM SIGSPATIAL’25 Proceedings. Therefore, we follow the same formatting requirements as ACM SIGSPATIAL’25 which can be found at <a href="https://sigspatial2025.sigspatial.org/">https://sigspatial2025.sigspatial.org/</a>. Manuscripts should be submitted in PDF format and formatted using the ACM camera-ready templates available at <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM camera-ready templates</a>. SIGSPATIAL uses the Conference Proceedings Primary Article template with two-column format. Alterations to the template, especially to gain more space, will be grounds for administrative rejection without further technical review. Submissions to ACM SIGSPATIAL are single-blind – i.e., the names and affiliations of the authors should be listed in the submitted version. The author list is considered to be final after the submission deadline and no changes to the author list are allowed for accepted papers.

## Important Dates

* **Paper Submission:** August 9, 2025
* **Notification of Acceptance:** September 26, 2025
* **Camera Ready Paper Due:** October 10, 2025
* **Workshop Date:** November 3, 2025
