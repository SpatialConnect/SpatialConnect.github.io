## Workshop Overview

SpatialConnect 2025 is dedicated to exploring cutting-edge research and applications in **Spatial Intelligence** aimed at shaping **Smart and Connected Communities (S&CC)**. The workshop will focus on how spatial data, AI, and human-centered design can be integrated to address community-scale challenges such as mobility equity, transportation optimization, energy efficiency, economic development, climate resilience, disaster response, and public health. We aim to forge new pathways for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers from academia, industry, and government to work together to enhance community resilience, promote sustainable growth, and create transformative, equitable urban experiences.

This workshop will catalyze innovative research that combines computational methods with community-driven priorities, addressing both environmental and socioeconomic challenges. It strives to align with global sustainable development goals while leveraging spatial intelligence to improve the quality of life for those who live, work, learn, or travel within these communities.

## Why SpatialConnect 2025?

SpatialConnect 2025 is an excellent fit for ACM SIGSPATIAL 2025 as it aligns directly with the conference's focus on spatial data science, geographic information systems, and spatiotemporal data mining, and urban computing. The workshop builds upon the National Science Foundation Smart and Connected Communities (S&CC) vision, which emphasizes interdisciplinary, community-engaged research that integrates technical innovations in spatial intelligence with real-world civic challenges.

{: style=" text-align: justify"}

**Spatial Intelligence** represents a growing frontier in the SIGSPATIAL community, where advanced spatial computing methods are increasingly developed and implemented to address critical societal priorities such as safety, sustainability, equity, and access to critical services.

## Call for Papers

We invite papers discussing novel research and applications in spatial intelligence for smart and connected communities without substantial overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings.

{: style=" text-align: justify"}

**We solicit high quality papers in the general areas of spatial intelligence for smart and connected communities.**

{: style=" text-align: justify"}

All submitted papers will be peer reviewed. If accepted, at least one of the authors must attend the workshop to present the work. Selected accepted papers will be recommended for submission to special issues of journals.

## Paper Submission

We invite papers discussing novel research and ideas without substantial overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings. Submitted papers can be of two types: 
{: style=" text-align: justify"}

1. {: style=" text-align: justify"} **Regular Research Papers:** These papers should report original research results or significant case studies. They should be **at most 10 pages.**  
2. {: style=" text-align: justify"} **Position Papers:** These papers should report novel research directions or identify challenging problems. They should be **at most 4 pages.** 

Manuscripts should be submitted in PDF format and formatted using the [ACM camera-ready templates](http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template){:target="_blank"}. Submissions are limited to 10 pages. All submissions should clearly present the author information including the names of the authors, the affiliations and the emails. 

{: style=" text-align: justify"}

All submitted papers will be peer reviewed. We have identified a set of researchers who are currently active in the related research areas as potential reviewers. One author per accepted workshop paper is required to register for both the main SIGSPATIAL conference and the workshop, to attend the workshop, and to present the accepted paper in the workshop. Otherwise, the accepted paper will not appear in the workshop proceedings or in the ACM Digital Library version of the workshop proceedings.
