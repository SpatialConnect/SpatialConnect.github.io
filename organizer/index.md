## Diversity and Inclusion

Our organizing committee is committed to promoting diversity and inclusion across multiple dimensions:

**Gender Diversity**: Our organizing and program committee includes a balanced representation of women and men researchers.

**Career Stage Diversity**: We have intentionally included both early-career and senior researchers to foster mentorship and knowledge exchange.

**Geographic Representation**: Our team spans multiple continents including North America, Asia, Oceania, and Europe, bringing diverse perspectives to spatial intelligence research.

**Disciplinary Diversity**: Committee members represent expertise across GIS, AI, Data Science, Urban Planning, Geography, Civil Engineering, Transportation, and Social Sciences.

**Institutional Diversity**: We include representatives from R1 research universities, industry, and government laboratories to ensure broad perspective on smart and connected communities challenges.

We have made intentional efforts to reach out to individuals from underrepresented groups and encourage emerging researchers to take leadership roles in our workshop activities.

## Workshop Vision

Our organizing team brings together complementary expertise in spatial computing, urban analytics, transportation systems, and community engagement. We are united by a shared vision of advancing spatial intelligence research that directly benefits communities and addresses real-world societal challenges.

The workshop organizers have extensive experience in:

* NSF Smart and Connected Communities research
* Interdisciplinary collaboration across computer science, engineering, and social sciences  
* Community-engaged research and participatory approaches
* Industry-academia partnerships
* International conference and workshop organization
* Diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in STEM

We look forward to creating an inclusive and innovative forum for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers working at the intersection of spatial intelligence and smart communities.
